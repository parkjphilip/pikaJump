# PikaJump

## MVP
pikaJump is a clone of [doodle jump](http://doodlejump.org/) written in javascript using Canvas. Sprites will be used for game images.

The goal of the game is to get as high as possible with pikachu. Each time pikachu
lands on a platform, he is given a boost, to try and reach another platform.
Platforms with springs will allow pikachu to jump higher. The higher pikachu is
able to ascend, the higher the user's score.
